    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 23, 2026 &middot; Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>WZJ Infinity Ltd ("we," "us," or "our") operates Convenu, an all-in-one trip planning and networking application available on the web and Android. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Convenu application and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in via Google OAuth, we receive your name, email address, and profile avatar. When you sign in via Telegram, we receive your Telegram user ID, first and last name, username, language preference, and premium status.</li>
      <li><strong>Itinerary Data:</strong> Trip names, descriptions, event details (titles, dates, times, locations, coordinates), transit information, and trip metrics you create within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Names, companies, positions, Telegram handles, email addresses, LinkedIn URLs, notes, and tags of contacts you add to your CRM. You may also add timestamped notes to individual contacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Wallet Information:</strong> Your Solana wallet public address when you connect a wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Telegram Bot Interactions:</strong> If you interact with the Convenu Telegram bot (@convenubot), we process commands and conversational state to provide bot features (creating contacts, itineraries, events). If you forward a Telegram message to the bot, the sender's name and username may be used to create or update a contact. Conversational state is temporary and deleted when you unlink your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> Browser type, operating system, and basic request metadata transmitted by standard web protocols.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use browser local storage to persist session state, theme preferences, and viewed shared itineraries on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Calendar:</strong> If you choose to import events, we access your Google Calendar data in read-only mode (scope: <code>calendar.readonly</code>). This data is used solely to populate itinerary events and is not stored on our servers beyond the itinerary records you create. Your Google Calendar access token is stored only in your browser session and is not persisted server-side.</li>
      <li><strong>Luma Events:</strong> If you provide a Luma (lu.ma) event URL, we fetch publicly available event details (title, date, location, description) from that URL to populate your itinerary. No Luma account credentials are accessed.</li>
      <li><strong>Telegram:</strong> Profile information provided through Telegram Mini App authentication, verified using HMAC-SHA256.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect GPS or device location data. All location data in itineraries is user-entered.</li>
      <li>We do not access your camera or microphone.</li>
      <li>We do not use analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs (no Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.).</li>
      <li>We do not collect private keys or seed phrases. Wallet signing occurs entirely within your wallet application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and maintain your account.</li>
      <li>Provide core features: itinerary planning, contact management, itinerary sharing, and Proof of Handshake verification.</li>
      <li>Mint compressed NFTs (cNFTs) on the Solana blockchain as verifiable records of completed handshakes.</li>
      <li>Calculate trust scores based on Telegram profile signals (premium status, profile photo, username, account age), wallet verification status, and handshake history.</li>
      <li>Award points for completed handshakes.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you regarding your account or the Service (e.g., magic link emails).</li>
      <li>Enable data portability features, including CSV export of contacts and PDF/print export of itineraries.</li>
      <li>Facilitate the Telegram bot for creating and managing contacts, itineraries, and events via chat commands.</li>
      <li>Enforce our Terms of Use and protect against misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <h3>4.1 With Other Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shared Itineraries:</strong> When you share an itinerary, the recipient can view trip details and events. Your email address is explicitly excluded from shared views.</li>
      <li><strong>Handshakes:</strong> When you initiate or accept a Proof of Handshake, both parties can see each other's name and wallet address.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 On the Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed Proof of Handshake records result in compressed NFTs minted on the Solana blockchain. Blockchain data, including wallet addresses and transaction metadata, is <strong>public and immutable</strong>. We cannot delete or modify blockchain records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 With Service Providers</h3>
    <table>

    <h3>4.4 Legal Requirements</h3>

    <h3>4.5 No Sale of Data</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Blockchain Data and Wallet Information</h2>
    <p>Convenu integrates with the Solana blockchain for Proof of Handshake functionality. Please be aware:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Ledger:</strong> Transactions on Solana are recorded on a public, decentralized ledger. Wallet addresses and transaction details are publicly visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be edited, deleted, or removed by us or any party.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Custody:</strong> You retain full control of your wallet and private keys. We never access, store, or transmit your private keys or seed phrases.</li>
      <li><strong>NFT Metadata:</strong> Compressed NFT metadata associated with handshakes may be stored permanently on-chain or on decentralized storage networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-Party Wallets:</strong> Wallet applications (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) are operated by third parties with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data is stored in a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled, ensuring users can only access their own data.</li>
      <li>Authentication tokens are verified server-side. Magic link tokens expire after 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Wallet ownership is verified through Ed25519 cryptographic signature verification.</li>
      <li>Input data is sanitized using DOMPurify to prevent cross-site scripting.</li>
      <li>We use HTTPS for all data transmission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we implement commercially reasonable safeguards, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Retained for as long as your account is active.</li>
      <li><strong>Itineraries and contacts:</strong> Retained until you delete them or delete your account.</li>
      <li><strong>Handshake records:</strong> Pending handshakes expire after 7 days. Completed handshake database records are retained; corresponding blockchain records are permanent.</li>
      <li><strong>Telegram bot state:</strong> Temporary conversational state is automatically deleted when you unlink your Telegram account. Link codes expire after 10 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain data:</strong> Permanent and immutable. Cannot be deleted.</li>
    </ul>
